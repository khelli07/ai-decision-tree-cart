# Decision Tree with CART Algorithm

This project is my personal exploration as well as an assignment to complete IF2120 Discrete Mathematics. I created a simple decision tree classifier module with CART Algorithm. The work is done so that I can have a thorough understanding of the decision tree before implementing it with Python libraries.
